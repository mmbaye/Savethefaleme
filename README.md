### Save The Falémé River
Welcome to the repository of a  project that aims to utilize Earth observation technology to meticulously study the water quality and pollution levels of the **Falémé River in Senegal** over a span of 30 years. This project seeks to harness the immense potential of remote sensing and geospatial data analysis to gain a profound understanding of the river's ecological health and identify potential pollution sources.
The Falémé River holds tremendous significance as a major water resource in Senegal, serving as an indispensable lifeline for both human and ecological systems. However, due to a myriad of anthropogenic activities and natural processes, the river's water quality has been subject to fluctuations and potential pollution throughout the years. It is of paramount importance to closely monitor and assess the long-term changes in water quality to ensure the sustainable management and preservation of this invaluable resource. In this project, we will leverage Earth observation data from a multitude of satellite missions, including **Landsat** and  **Sentinel-2**, to gather an extensive array of temporal and spatial information about the Falémé River and its surrounding areas. By employing advanced image processing techniques, we will derive pivotal water quality parameters such as turbidity, chlorophyll-a concentration, and suspended sediment load.
Moreover, we will integrate ground-based water quality measurements, hydrological data, and meteorological information to establish robust correlations and validate the remote sensing-derived results. This innovative approach of fusing data from multiple sources will significantly enhance the accuracy and reliability of our findings, enabling us to create a comprehensive and intricate depiction of the river's water quality dynamics.

The outcomes of this study will not only contribute to a profound understanding of the Falémé River's pollution levels, but will also provide invaluable insights for policymakers, environmental agencies, and local communities involved in the sustainable management of water resources. These findings can aid in formulating effective pollution mitigation strategies, implementing targeted restoration initiatives, and fostering broader awareness about the significance of preserving our natural water bodies.

Summary of Pollution Issues on the Falémé River

**Primary Cause: Illegal Gold Mining**
Gold mining, often done illegally, is the largest source of pollution in the Falémé River.
Gold panners (miners) dredge the riverbed, increasing muddiness and disrupting the natural flow.
Dangerous Chemicals:
Miners use extremely harmful chemicals like mercury and cyanide for gold extraction, which contaminate the water.
Impact on Aquatic Life:
Fish populations are dwindling due to the pollution, harming a key food source for locals.
**Agricultural Threat:**
Polluted water makes irrigation unsafe, damaging crops and impacting livelihoods.
Human Health:
Drinking contaminated river water and consuming fish from the river poses significant health risks.
Cross-Border Problem
The Falémé River forms part of the Mali-Senegal border, and pollution impacts both countries.
**Additional Notes:**
Reports note companies like AfriGold contribute to pollution due to inadequate waste disposal. Increased awareness campaigns are pressuring government and miners, but solutions are slow to materialize.
